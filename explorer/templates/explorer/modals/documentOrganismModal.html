                    The taxonomic names listed in the <strong>Organisms</strong> panel at the bottom of this page
                    represent taxa to which were likely referred in the article <strong>{{ document.title }}</strong>.
                    This list was generated using a technique called <strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</strong>.

                    NER is a machine learning technique for detecting references to classes of
                    concepts, or entities, in texts. NER models typically focus on detecting references to people,
                    organizations, and places, but can also find things like currency, quantities, and organisms.
                    NER isn't fool-proof: the quality of the results depend both on the suitability of the NER model
                    and on the quality of the texts.

                    We used an NER model called LINNAEUS to find references to taxa in <em>JHB</em> articles. LINNAEUS
                    was trained on abstracts in the PubMed database, and is unusual among NER models in that it also
                    tries to disambiguate the entities that it finds. In other words, it identifies not merely
                    <strong>that</strong> a passage refers to an organism, but also <strong>
                    which specific organism</strong> is being discussed. LINNAEUS' vocabulary of organisms is the NCBI
                    Taxonomy database, which means that we can retrieve additional information about each organism
                    discussed in <em>JHB</em> using the NCBI Entrez APIs.
